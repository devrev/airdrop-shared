Validate :NormalizationFunction: with :ChefCLI: for the "{{ record_type }}" record type with the following flow:
  - Step 1.: Invoke :ExtractionFunction: using the resource [data_extraction_test.json](test_data/data_extraction_test.json).
  - Step 2.: Retrieve full extracted file path (`:= fullExtractedFilePath`)
    - The extracted file name (`:= extractedFileName`) is the name of the file created by :ExtractionFunction:
    - extractedFileName is located in the folder provided in the environment variable "EXTRACTED_FILES_FOLDER_PATH".
    - To retrieve extractedFileName, execute the following command: `ls EXTRACTED_FILES_FOLDER_PATH | grep extractor_{{ record_type }} | sort -r | head -n 1`
    - The test should fail the folder "EXTRACTED_FILES_FOLDER_PATH" does not exist or if the extractedFileName is not found.
    - fullExtractedFilePath is the full path to the extractedFileName.
  - Step 3.: In :ConformanceTests:, create a separate file for :ExternalDomainMetadataJSONObject:. Contents of :ExternalDomainMetadataJSONObject: JSON object **MUST NOT** be modified compared to the original file contents.
  - Step 4.: Validate :NormalizationFunction: with :ChefCLI: using the command `"${CHEF_CLI_PATH}" validate-data -m <path to :ExternalDomainMetadataJSONObject: file> -r {{ record_type }} < <fullExtractedFilePath>`:
    - Validation is successful precisely when both the stdout and stderr of :ChefCLI: are empty.
    - Expect the validation of :ChefCLI: to succeed. If it fails, normalization method for "{{ record_type }}" in :Implementation: should be fixed.
    - For the validation of :NormalizationFunction: to be successful The :ChefCLI: must return an empty output. Note that the implementation of :ExtractionFunction: directly infuences the output of :ChefCLI:.
    - The stdout and stderr of :ChefCLI: *MUST* be printed to the console.
