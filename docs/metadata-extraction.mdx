  ### Configure state transitions

  If an external record type has some concept of states, between which only certain transitions are 
  possible (for example, to move to the `resolved` status, an issue first has to be `in_testing`), you 
  can declare these in the metadata too.

  This allows creation of a matching *stage diagram* (a collection of stages and their permitted 
  transitions) in DevRev, which enables a much simpler import and a closer preservation of the external 
  data than mapping to DevRev's built-in stages.

  To declare this in the metadata, make sure the status is represented as an enum field, and then 
  declare the allowed transitions (which you might have to retrieve from an API at runtime, if they 
  are also customized):

  ```json
  {
    "fields": {
      "status": {
        "name": "Status",
        "is_required": true,
        "type": "enum",
        "enum": {
          "values": [
            {
              "key": "detected",
              "name": "Detected"
            },
            {
              "key": "mitigated",
              "name": "Mitigated"
            },
            {
              "key": "rca_ready",
              "name": "RCA Ready"
            },
            {
              "key": "archived",
              "name": "Archived"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    "stage_diagram": {
      "controlling_field": "status",
      "starting_stage": "detected",
      "all_transitions_allowed": false,
      "stages": {
        "detected": {
          "transitions_to": ["mitigated", "archived", "rca_ready"],
          "state": "new"
        },
        "mitigated": {
          "transitions_to": ["archived", "detected"],
          "state": "work_in_progress"
        },
        "rca_ready": {
          "transitions_to": ["archived"],
          "state": "work_in_progress"
        },
        "archived": {
          "transitions_to": [],
          "state": "completed"
        }
      },
      "states": {
        "new": {
          "name": "New"
        },
        "work_in_progress": {
          "name": "Work in Progress"
        },
        "completed": {
          "name": "Completed",
          "is_end_state": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  In the above example:
  - The status field is the controlling field of the stage diagram.
  - If a status field has no explicit transitions but you still want a stage diagram, set `all_transitions_allowed` to `true`, which creates a diagram where all the defined stages can transition to each other.
  - External systems may categorize statuses (like Jira's status categories), which can be included in the diagram metadata (`states` in the example).
  - The `starting_stage` defines the initial stage for new object instances. This data should always be provided if available, otherwise the starting stage is selected alphabetically.
  - The order and human-readable name are taken from the enum values defined on the controlling field.
  - If the `states` field is not provided, default DevRev states are used: `open`, `in_progress`, and `closed`.
